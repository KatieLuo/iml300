    <h1 > What is the Asian American experience?</h1>
    
    <p> Try searching up "Asian American" and your search browser floods with dozens of articles from 2021‚Å†‚Äî most of them sprouting from the 2021 Atlanta spa shooting where six Asian women were killed. Notice that before then, there's little trace of what it means to be Asian American on the internet. Likewise, this lack of representation can be seen across all American media. Despite a growing Asian American population of 19 million residents, Western media still struggles to depict the Asian American experience.
    </p>

    <p> Perhaps this lack of representation is not just due to the agonizingly slow process of representation in the entertainment industry, but also the confusion about what the Asian American experiece is actually about. And that in itself is no easy question to answer. If we disect the term Asian American, we have "Asian" and "American", connotating a mixed experience of both idenities. Asia covers covers roughly 4.6 billion people and 48 countries; however, colloquially, "Asian" means East Asian. Pop culture and movies assume films such as "Crazy Rich Asians" adequate representation of Asians, but this is obviously not the case. The term Asian American houses a plethora of identities and experiences‚Å†‚Äî and is also the most <b>underrepresented and misunderstood</b>.
    </p>

    
    <P>Each Asian American experience is unique from another. Not to dismiss the many shared values and beliefs which characterize many Asian American lived experiences, however, each experience holds its own story in the sense that the term "Asian American" sprawls across dozens of identities: first-generation, second-generation (and on), Southeast Asian, Pacific Islander, East Asian, Central Asian and more. Below, I have listed out the five regions of Asia and the meaning of each generation, thus disecting (and simplifying, although this is more complex) "Asian" and "American." Click on the headings for each category to learn more about what the terms mean in respect to identity. 
    </P>
    
    <p><b><a class= "foot" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Asia"> Five Regions of Asia üåè</a></b></p>
    <p class="small"> Central Asia is west of China, south of Russia, and north of Afghanistan:Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan. </p>
    <p class="small"> East Asia is located east of Central Asia, with its eastern border running along the East China Sea:  China, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau</p>
    <p class="small">South Asia is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south, the Bay of Bengal to the east, and the Arabian Sea to the west: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Iran, and the Maldives</p>
    <p class="small">Southeast Asia is located north of Australia, south of East Asia, west of the Pacific Ocean, and east of the Bay of Bengal:Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor Leste, and Vietnam </p>

    <p>Although the Asian Ameican experience is much more complex than the defentitions listed above, hopefully these terms help showcase the wide variety of identies that "Asian American" covers.
