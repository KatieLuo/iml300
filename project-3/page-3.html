                    As you resize the timeline, notice how the space that each film takes up. The most recent films take up the smallest window size and the older films take up the largest window space. The most recent films display the best Asian American representation and the older films show racist and stereotypical tropes. The window space is a physical representation of how much space each film takes up in time and history. Since the beginning of Western media, Asian Americans have been poorly represented, taking up a large space in cinema practices and has had lasting effects such as Orientalism.  While in recent years, there has been more positive representation of Asian Americans, there is still a lot of room to improve, grow, and expand.
