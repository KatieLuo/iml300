    <h1> Good Representation (for now)</h1>
    
    <p> Hover over the films below to see why they are good representation. Although many of these films are flawed in its own ways, they are‚Äîfor the most part‚Äîa step in the right direction. </p>
    
    <p> Note: It was especially difficult finding media that represents the Pacific Islander community well. This is just another reflection of the lack of diversity within an already representation-bare industry.</p>

            <p>Hulu's "The Mindy Project" is about an Indian-American ob-gyn, Mindy Lahiri, who naviagtes her career life and romantic relationships. This film redirects South Asian women roles in film. While many shows such as "Master of None" and "The Night Of" cast South Asian women as undesirable side-characters, "The Mindy Project" gives an Indian-American woman the proper amount of space to be nuanced and interesting. </p>

            <p>While "Kim's Convenience" has had it's fair share of criticisms for a racist writers' room, it still hits the spot for a heartwarming portrayal of a Korean-Canadian family who runs a small corner store. It is "quietly revolutionary" for being one of the most successful mainstream Asian immigrant stories.</p>

            <p>"Boy" is about a 11-year-old Maori boy whos world is centered around Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video.

Boy, the main character, imagines his absent father as a version of Michael Jackson. The film elegantly explores the complexity of family dysfunction and hero worship. </p>

            <p>"Raya and The Last Dragon" introduces Disney's first Southeast Asian princess. The animated film, set in the fantastical world of Kumandra, in inspired by Southeast Asian cultures. The film was co-written by Vietnamese-American screenwriter Qui Nguyen and Malaysian screenwriter Adele Lim. This film allows for Southeast representation behind and on the screen. While the film references several cultures and traditions by casting a wider net, combining multiple Southeast Asian countries' cultures into one is questionable.</p>

            <p>"The Half Of It" highlights the intersectionality of the female, queer, Asian American youth. This film is director Alice Wu's second film‚Äî both featuring characters of similar backgorunds. Although the premise of both her films are fairly similar on the surface level, both tell different nuanced stories. In "The Half Of It," highschooler, Ellie Chu, experiences heart break and self-discovery. Wu's films are so well done because she puts her own life into her work. The protagonists are imperfect, yet lovable people. </p>

            <p>"The Green Knight," casted by Dev Patel, created room for good representation through its diverse cast. The film does not directly speak on its diversity, however, the casting choices have have spoken volumes for the Southeast Asian community. Rarely do we see blockbuster of this scale cast Asian characters is a film inspired by the sixth-century British Isles. </p>

            <p>"Sound of Metal" represents the deaf and South Asian communities in modern cinema. Darius Marder's film follows a flawed musician, Riz Ahmed, who struggles with the loss of his hearing. The film is compassionate and multi-dimensional; Ahmed does not address his racial ties, but he is a wonderfully written character that is usually saved for white actors.  </p>

The characters battle intergenerational conflicts and the "American Dream." "Minari" has been claimed to be the perfect representation of openness and diversity in Hollywood.</p>
