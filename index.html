    <h1>Some thoughts on digital and multi-media artists and theories...</h1>
    
    
    <p> “Artist and Computer” granted me great insight on how diverse computer generated art is. Looking through these artists’ works and statements inspired me to be more curious about the way we interact with and manipulate technology. I was inspired by the strategies each artist used to challenge traditional notions dividing the human and the computer. For example, I enjoyed Ben Laposky’s “Electronic Abstractions” and his characterization of oscillons as “visual music”-- a new concept that I now want to explore in future projects. I also enjoyed reading about Patsy Scala who works with video tapes using computer input. She’s really funny for the way she talks about computer generated art being her choosing of art form because of her frustration and impatience for everything else. Looking at the two readings together, I appreciated how we looked at the history of computer generated art in the context of women since “Artist and Computer” featured more men. </p>


    <p> To begin, I have always seen “GUI” before, but never realized it was actually pronounced “gooey”. While reading the article, I was interested in the way the article talked about racial inequity through technology. It reminded me of the google photos problem that happened last year where the app was identifying black people as apes. It reinforced the idea that, like most systems and products, they are usually built by and for the white man. I kept thinking about how the article was using white text on a black page to practice what it was saying— I thought “wow, that’s so meta!”
    </p>

    <p> Watching the AOL advertisement felt like I was time-traveling to a foreign time. I forget how much I take for granted since the internet seems so habitually integrated into our lives. The way the internet was described also felt so ironic; they called it a time saver for allowing people to get their work done at home. But now, the easy accessibility is more prevalent than ever because of the pandemic. I would argue that the internet has increased work hours because people are expected to do more when working at home with their devices. I had to pause when Odell wrote “now Target is talking to us, via a 16-year-old girl in her living room.” Sponsorships feel so normal, but after reading this, it made me realize how unnatural it feels. It seems as if almost everything we consume or create comes with the intent to capitalize. </p>

    <p>McCarthy’s speech was incredibly interesting. I especially loved her piece “Social Turkers”. While I was making the presentation on her, I further researched this piece and saw the notes made by the paid watchers. I couldn’t help but wonder what would happen if we did this experiment today with the students at USC. In fact, I thought about recreating many of her social pieces because they just seem so fun and interesting. I also loved the way many of her pieces are presented. Several times she mentions the artist who she regularly collaborated with to create her videos. I thought this was a great example of how different artists with niche mediums and interests can come together to create and present something so powerful. The videos felt like any other advertisement, but were so satirical and comedic.
    </p>

    <p>It seems to be that the internet is not only a platform hosting an unlimited library of poor images, but also a hub for people to create poor images from. I had never thought too deeply about poor images as it has always seemed a part of technological culture where we borrow and reinterpret media produced by others. It almost seems like second nature to prize the original image that has the highest resolution and best quality, but it makes sense that poor images are still the most popular. Like anything else that has been commodified, items are first seen for their utility over aesthetic or origin. Only those who are able to afford their own images and consume purely raw content from the original source can ignore the low resolutions of poor images.
    </p>

    <p>This TedX further reinforces the idea that like most things in society, much of technology is created for and by white men. The video also reminded me of an article I read surrounding facial recognition from surveillance cameras. In summary the article argued the weaponization of doorbell cameras such as those like Ring which is being used to create a nation-wide network of surveillance cameras connected to Nextdoor. The problem with this is that the facial recognition software in the doorbells—similar to what Buolamwini discussed—racially profiled black bodies. This information, although not new, is extremely frightening. If AI is the future, we have to make sure that we find a way to keep implicit biases out of the system.</p>

    <p>As I was clicking through the Contributors Zine, I was shocked by how diverse each person was. I couldn't believe that one of them was nine years old! It was also interesting to see how differently p5.js is used from physics simulations to weaving patterns. For the TedTalk, I enjoyed how Adichie presented the danger of the single story. I've always known that single narratives are bad, but Adichie put into perspective the importance of the narratives we are creating right now and how they come in to play. I also thought about the luxury of traveling and being able to see different parts of the world for yourself. Questions: If there are other narratives that don't follow the single story, how do we uplift those voices, like how her publisher did? How do we unlearn the ideas and notions of who has power? How do we teach young people early on how to not follow these tropes?</p>

    <p> I really enjoyed Melenciano’s talk; she connects so many points that I am also interested in such as sustainability and the technological and human relationship. I really resonated with her closing statement regarding instant gratification— usually garnered from social media. It is so difficult to separate creating for external appreciation versus internal appreciation when almost all the media you consume feels like a constant measurement of something greater than just a post. I appreciate how Melenciano emphasizes thinking about the future. The way she explains sustainable design that goes beyond the traditional human centered design helped clear up a lot of confusion for me surrounding capitalism and design. </p>
